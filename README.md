# How To Use
Scenario: Navigate to https://www.ti.com/, click on **Ship to**, search for **Vietnam**.

I inspect the **Ship to** element to detect its locator from the HTML DOM:
<img width="1401" alt="31d0027d-6552-4cfd-97aa-5fcfb61e5abb" src="https://github.com/vikim97/ShadowDom/assets/85481702/41ea624e-8d56-4a42-8da9-5190fb7e27d0">

Right-click on the `class="header-llc-sidesheet-preview"` that stands for the Ship to element > Copy > Copy JS path.
